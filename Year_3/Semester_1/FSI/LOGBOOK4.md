# Environment Variable andSet-UIDProgram Lab

##  2 - Lab Tassks

### 2.2 - Step 1

After analyzing the output, it seems to be very similar, if not identical, to what is outputted if you type "printenv" or "env" in a shell.

### 2.2 - Step 2

The output seems to be the same as the child environment, and after typing "diff file1 file2" in the shell, nothing showed up, confirming that the files are identical.

#### 2.2 - Step 3

As the outputs are the same, we conclude that the environments of both parent and child are also the same, so we can confirm that he parentâ€™s environment variables are inherited by the child process.

### 2.3 - Step 1

Nothing is printed, so there is no environment.

### 2.3 - Step 2

The environment variables are printed.

### 2.3 - Step 3

We can conclude that the program gets its environment variables from external locations, as we can see with the line "extern char **environ;", which could result in an attack if the attacker has access to the envirnoment itself.

### 2.5  - Step 3

After running the code, the variables I created did not get into the SET-UID child process.

### 2.6

No, we can't run our malicious code as the enviromeent variables in SET_UID do not get into child processes.

#### 2.7 - Step 2

- Regular program, regular user: runs mylib.c instead of myprog.c
- SET-UID root program, regular user: runs myprog.c as intended
- SET-UID root program, regular user with exported environment variable: runs myprog.c as intended
- SET-UID user1 program, non-root user with exported environment variable: runs mylib.c instead of myprog.c
