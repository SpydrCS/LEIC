Agent
	Anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators

Rational agent
	does the right/correct thing
	ideal rational agent:
		for each sequence of perceptions, does action that maximizes measure of performance
	mapping between perceptions and actions

Intelligent agent
	Agent = architecture + program
	agent function is abstract mathematical description
	agent program is specific implementations, running on some physical system
	structure:
		agent displays behavior-action that is performed after given sequence of perceptions
	requisites:
		perceive environment (sensors)
		decide actions to execute (think)
		execute actions in environment using its actuators
		communicate?

agents vs objects:
	agents decide what to do
	object methods are called externally
	agents react ot sensors and control actuators
	"objects do it for free, agents do it for money"

agent program/types
	internal data structures are updated using perceptions and used to make decision of the actions to be performed (best action)

the nature of environments: PEAS
	when designing an agent, the first task is to characterize its task environment and the task
	PEAS:
		performance measure
		environment
		actuators
		sensors

properties of environments:
	acessible vs inaccessible
		if agent sensors can detect everything that is relevant in environment
	deterministic vs not
		if next state is determined by previous state and agent's actions
	episodic vs not
		divided into episodes
		subsequent episodes do not rely on actions in previous episodes
	static vs dynamic
		dynamic if it changes while agent is thinking
	discrete vs continuous
		discrete if there is finite number of perceptions and actions
	singles agent vs multi-agent
		agent operating alone in environment vs multiple (cooperative or competitive)

basic types of agents:
	simple reactive/reflex agents
		based on if-then rules table
		example:
			if state = dirty, return suck
			else = return switch
	Agents with world representation
		model-based reflex agents
		maintain internal state (representation of world)
	Objective-based agents
		description of state of world and objective to be achieved
		example of objective: getting from porto to lisbon
		problem solving by search, planning
	Utility-based agents
		utility: performance measure
		kind of agent's degree of happiness
		maps current state to a value
	Learning Agents
		learning element and performance evaluation element
		performance increases over time by using machine learning
	BDI Agents
		three "mental attitudes" (BDI)
			(B)eliefs (information) - information the agent has about world
			(D)esires (motivation) - all possible states of affairs that the agent might like to accomplish
			(I)ntentions (deliberation) - all states of affairs that agent decided to work towards

Multi-agent system (MAS)
	multiple agent that:
		exhibit autonomous behaviour
		interact with the other agents in system
