agents for problem solving
	“Problem Solving Agent”: Tries to find the sequence of actions that leads to a desirable state

problem formulation:
	what are possible actions?
	what are possible states?
	how to evaluate states
search problem:
	solution; sequence of actions
	final stage is execution

formulate -> search -> execute

search problems:
	definition:
		set S of states (possible infinite)
		initial state s: s (inside) S
		transition relationship T across state space
		set of final (objective) states O: O (inside) S

problem can be represented by a graph, where:
	nodes represent states
	arcs (connections) represent pairs of transition relation
problem solved by finding path between initial state and objective state

agents for problem solving:
	problem formulation:
		state representation
		initial (current) state
		objective test (define desired states)
		operators (name, preconditions, effects, cost)
		solution cost

problem formulation:
	single state problems - deterministic and acessible environment
	multiple state problems - deterministic but inaccessible environment
	contingency problems - non-deterministic and inaccessible environment, sensors must be used during execution, solution is a tree or policy)
	exploration problems - (unknown state space)
